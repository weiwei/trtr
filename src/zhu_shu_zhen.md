English Translation on Zhu Shuzhen's Heart-broken Poems

朱淑真断肠诗词英译

谢艳明译著

150. 初冬书怀

触目园池景, 荷枯菊已荒。 
风寒侵夜枕, 霜冻怯晨妆。 
江上风翻赤, 庭前橘带黄。 
题诗欲排闷, 对景倍悲伤。

Writing of Thoughts in the Early Winter

I catch sight of the scene in th' garden pond 
Where lotus is withered and daisy's dried. 
The chilly wind encroaches my night pillow, 
And the frost makes my dress-up terrified. 
The wind on river rolls ahead in red; 
Tangerines before my court are yellow dyed. 
I'm to dispel my woes by writing poems, 
But the scene makes my sorrows multiplied.

77. 独坐

卷帘待明月,拂槛对西风。 
夜气涵秋色, 瑶河浸碧空。 
草根鸣蟋蟀, 天外叫冥鸿。 
几许旧时事, 今宵谁与同。

Sitting Alone

I rolled up curtain, waiting for the moon, 
And held the railing and felt the west wind. 
In the night air I saw the autumn loom, 
And in the Milky Way the blue sky's cleaned. 
Crickets chirped and chirped at the roots of grass, 
And high in sky was seen wild geese's flight. 
To my mind came memories of the past; 
Who is it could share them with me tonight?
