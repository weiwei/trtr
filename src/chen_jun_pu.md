A Small Pond *

The fountain drips soundless as if to spare its flow; 
Bright and gentle, the water mirrors the tree shadow. 
As soon as the little lotus puts out its budding tip, ** 
A dragonfly has already alighted on it his joy to show.

泉眼无声惜细流,
树阴照水爱晴柔。
小荷才露尖尖角,**
早有蜻蜓立上头。

The Potter *

All the earth around has gone to making tiles, 
Yet the potters have not had a house tile-roofed. 
Those whose fingers are ne'er stained with mud 
Are living in glittering mansions that stand aloft.

陶者*

陶尽门前土,
屋上无片瓦。
十指不沾泥,
鳞鳞居大厦。


Thoughts upon Reading *

The half mu of the square pond is a mirror bright, **
Wherein play both the cloud
shadow and sunlight. Whence comes the water, so clear and so clean? 
Nothing, only there is a live source running quiet.


观书有感 *

半亩方塘一鉴开, 
天光云影共徘徊。 
问渠那得清如许, 
为有源头活水来。

Howling Gale and Torrential Rain on 4th of November *

Cold and alone in a hut, my sadness comes to no end, 
As the northern borders I am still keen to defend. ** 
In deep night, I lie down and listen to the gale and rain; 
Into my dream, across an icy river crack cavaliers wend.


十一月四日风雨大作*

僵卧孤村不自哀,
 尚思为国戍轮台。** 
 夜阑卧听风吹雨, 
 铁马冰河入梦来。


The River Wu *

Living, be a lion-hearted man, 
Dead, a spirit heroic and true. 
That's why, I think, Xiang Yu, 
Refused to cross the River Wu

乌江*

生当作人杰, 死亦为鬼雄。 至今思项羽, 不肯过江东。

New Year's Day *

200 Chinese-English Quatrains by Song Poets
Amid the bursts of firecrackers, the old year's now to go,
The spring wind sends warmth into the wine Tu Su. *
When the sun is shining on each and every household, We all hurry to change old peach boards with the new. **

元日

爆竹声中一岁除,
春风送暖入屠苏。*
千门万户瞳瞳日,
总把新桃换旧符。**


The Silkworm-Raising Woman *

I went into the town yesterday 
And shed endless tears on return: 
Those who wear silk dresses Raise no worms, 
I come to learn.

蚕妇*

昨日入城市, 
归来泪满巾。 
遍身罗绮者, 
不是养蚕人。
