蒹葭
蒹葭苍苍,白露为霜。所谓伊人,在水一方。 溯洄从之,道阻且长;溯游从之,宛在水中央。 蒹葭凄凄,白露未晞。所谓伊人,在水之湄。 溯洄从之,道阻且跻,溯游从之,宛在水中坻。 蒹葭采采,白露未已。所谓伊人,在水之滨。 溯洄从之,道阻且右;溯游从之,宛在水中沚。

【今译】
郁郁苍苍的芦苇上,冷露凝作薄霜。 心头怀念的人呵,站在前面河岸旁。 逆着水流走去,崎岖的小路弯又长。 顺着河道寻去,她好像围在水中央。
萋萋苍苍的芦苇上,夜露还没吹干。 心头怀念的人呵,站在河岸青草间。 逆着水流走去,那小路坎坷而艰难。 顺着河道寻去,她好像伫立小岛前。
青青葱葱的芦苇上,露珠儿依然亮晶晶。 心头怀念的人呵,恍恍惚惚她岸边的影儿。 逆着水流走去,那小路迂回而难行。 顺着河道寻去,她好像隐在绿洲中。

Reeds Green
Exub'rant, exub'rant -- reeds in darkish greens; [5步】
There shimmers a light frost instead of dewdrops agleam.
My dear beloved, where can you be found?? 
You're there ahead, to be sure, the waters beyond.³
I saunter upstream to look for traces, for her, 
Proceeding along the river long and curved. 
I saunter downstream looking about for her trace; 
Meseems she's 'mid the waters upon the waves.

Profusely, profusely reeds alongshore green. 
And not yet dried are dewdrops clear and serence. 
My dear beloved, where do you now hide? 
You're there ahead, to be sure, the waters beside.
I saunter upstream to look for traces, for her, 
Proceeding along the bank uneven and curved, 
I saunter downstream a-searching high and low, 
Meseems she's 'mid the waters upon a shoal.

So lush, so lush are reeds by shallows green. 
Still sparkling there the dewdrops crystal-clean. 
My dear beloved, where's your figure fair? 
You're there ahead, to be sure, the waters before.
I saunter upstream to look for traces, for her, 
Proceeding along the streamway that winds and turns. 
I saunter downstream a-tracking on and on, 
Meseems she's 'mid the waters an islet upon.

行行重行行 360
古诗十九首之一
行行重行行,与君生别离。
相去万余里,各在天一涯。
道路阻且长,会面安可知?
胡马依北风,越鸟巢南枝。
相去日以远,衣带日以缓。
浮云蔽白日,游子不顾返。
思君令人老,岁月忽已晚。
弃捐勿复道,努力加餐饭!

Trudging On and On
E'er on and on you're trudging your way,[抑扬4] 
Being torn away by force from me. 
A myriad miles extend between, 
We're each beyond the horizon unseen. 
E'er arduous and tortuous, your way you toil, 
To get together we've scarce chance at all. 1 
The Northern horse is attached to the vast, 
While a Southern bird belongs in her nest.
Still farther and farther you travel away; 
I'm wasting thinner from day to day.² 
Bedimmed the sun by clouds so dark, 
The tramp is kept afar from his hearth. 
O missing you renders me old and gray, 
So quietly and swiftly advancing my age. 
Deserted, not any more I'll whine; 
Just pray you to pluck up your heart to survive!

黄鹤楼
崔颢(700-754)
昔人已乘黄鹤去,此地空余黄鹤楼。 黄鹤一去不复返,白云千载空悠悠。 晴川历历汉阳树,芳草萋萋鹦鹉洲。 日暮乡关何处是?烟波江上使人愁!

Yellow Crane Tower
Astride the yellow crane the ancient sage was gone. [6音步] 
What use a tower after its name to be left hereupon?
Once gone, the yellow crane is never coming back.¹
Alone there cloudlets white forever waft and waft. 
Tis fine -- across the river, trees serene are seen. 
Upstream on Parrot Islet, grass looks gracefully green. 
With twilight dimming, where to discern my home afar? 
By mist enveloped the waves, and heavily laden my heart.

无题
李商隐
相见时难别亦难,东风无力百花残。 春蚕到死丝方尽,蜡炬成灰泪始干。 晓镜但愁云鬓改,夜吟应觉月光寒。 蓬莱此去无多路、青鸟殷勤为探看。

A Poem Untitled
'Tis hard for us to get together, harder to part. [6音步] 
By a languid easterly wind, all blossoms blown apart. 
O not until he's utterly exhausted late in Spring 
Does he, the silkworm, cease his silk from bosom to spin.¹ 
While she is not yet burnt herself into cinders dead, 
The candle cannot help but hot tears shed and shed.
"Regrettable - in morning mirror hair locks looking changed,"
"Thro' night recitals moonlight must be felt so chilled." 3 
Although, in fact, my fairyland's not too far a cry, 
There's only the bluebird entrusted between us two to ply.

醉花荫
李清照
薄雾浓云愁永昼,瑞脑销金兽。 佳节又重阳,玉枕纱厨,半夜凉初透。
东篱把酒黄昏后,有暗香盈袖。
莫道不销魂,帘卷西风,人比黄花瘦。

To the Tune Drunk Beneath Blossoms
With mists thin or clouds thick, lingers the dreary day; [5音步] 
In the "gold-lion" censer, burns coiled incense away. 2 
Shouldn't be cheered the returning Double Ninth? 
Jade pillow and gauze net no longer serving me right,³ 
Allowing the first chill to steal in, deep in the night.
O'er blossoms by eastern hedge a wine cup lifting, 
By dusk, has filled my sleeves with aroma affecting." 
Don't say, will you? My heart isn't melting in the blues! 
Up-rolling the curtain, the Zephyr sees a figure - 
Compared with the yellow flowers, she's the thinner!

临江仙·说秦汉
(明)杨慎(1488-1559)
滚滚长江东逝水,浪花淘尽英雄。 是非成败转头空。
青山依旧在,几度夕阳红?
白发渔樵江渚上,惯看秋月春风。 一壶浊酒喜相逢。
古今多少事,都付笑谈中!

Chatting About Qin and Han Dynasties (To the Tune Fairy Upon the River)
Rolling on and on e'er eastward the River Great, [扬抑6] 
All those countless heroes by torrents are washed away, 
Right or wrong, successes or losses, ending in smoke. 
Mountains green alone remain from days of old. 
Merely several times, it seems, have sunsets glowed!¹
Hoar-haired fisher and woodcutter live by the riverside, 
Vernal breeze and autumn moon refreshing their lives.
Cheerful chitchats they have o'er jugs of homemade wine.² 
What a lot of momentous occurrences recent or remote 
Now are bandied about with laughs, with amusing jokes!³

一剪梅
李清照
红藕香残玉簟秋。
轻解罗裳,独上兰舟。
云中谁寄锦书来?
雁字回时,月满西楼。
花自飘零水自流。
一种相思,两处闲愁。
此情无计可消除:
才下眉头,又上心头!

To the Tune One Winter-Sweet Sprig
Our lotuses pink decay, their fragrance fails. [5音步] 
The cattail mat a little chilly feels. 
My lengthy silken skirt unloosening quiet, 
Alone I set my rowing boat adrift. 
"Tis a cordial letter coming in clouds for me? 
In neat array arriving the messenger-geese,¹ 
The Western Tower is steeped in lunar beams.

With fallen flowers following the flows, [4音步] 
Unceasing streams ne'er heed us folk. 
One common longing, of both our souls, 
Has each one languishing, severed remote. 
The nuisance you're never able to elude --
From brows it's been hardly driven apart, 
It'd come at once to gnaw at your heart.
