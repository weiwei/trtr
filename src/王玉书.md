赠卫八处士
杜甫

```
人生不相见, 动如参与商。
今夕复何夕? 共此灯烛光。
少壮能几时, 鬓发各已苍。
访旧半为鬼, 惊呼热中肠。
焉知二十载, 重上君子堂?
昔别君未婚, 儿女忽成行。
```

To Hermit Wei the Eighth

Du Fu

```
In real life it's common for friends to part 
Like the two stars Shen and Shang e'er apart. 
But alas, what a night it is tonight, 
When you and I share the same candle light. 
We cannot be forever young and strong 
And our hairs have turned to grey before long. 
Half our friends I visit have been ghosts, find I, 
Which roasts my bowels and makes me cry. 
Unexpectedly, after twenty years 
I should once again come to call at yours. 
When we parted you were a bachelor; 
Now, of your children there're quite a number.

宣州谢胱楼饯别校书叔云

李白

```
弃我去者昨日之日不可留, 
乱我心者今日之日多烦忧。
长风万里送秋雁, 
对此可以酣高楼。
蓬莱文章建安骨, 
中间小谢又清发。 
俱怀逸兴壮思飞, 
欲上青天览明月。 
抽刀断水水更流, 
举杯消愁愁更愁。
人生在世不称意, 
明朝散发弄扁舟。
```
Saying Good-bye to Uncle Yun, the Imperial Librarian, at Xie Tiao's Pavilion in Xuanzhou

Li Bai

```
Yesterday, the day that gave me up, is gone fore'er; 
Today, the day that stirs my heart, gives me peace ne'er. 
Far away will long wind carry autumn wild geese; 
In the high tower we may have a good drink for this. 
Like ancient poets', your writing is of power full 
While mine like junior Xie's is clear-cut and graceful. 
We two, full of strong zest and will, would fly as soon 
As not up to the blue sky to snatch the bright moon. 
Running water when cut with sword will farther flow; 
My sorrow when quenched with a drink will deeper grow. 
If we can't get on in a satisfactory way, 
We'd better roam in a boat with loosened hairs next day.
```

天末怀李白

杜甫

```
凉风起天末,
君子意如何?
鸿雁几时到?
江湖秋水多。
文章憎命达, 
魑魅喜人过。
应共冤魂语, 
投诗赠汨罗。
```

Thinking of Li Bai at the End of the Sky

Du Fu

```
Here, at the end of the sky, I feel cold wind blows.
What your mental state is these days, nobody knows.
When will the wild goose come that brings your news to me?
So full are autumn rivers and lakes on your journey!
In literary talent, good fortune isn't to lie
While demons are glad to see careless passersby.
Of the drowned poet's being wronged, you've your feelings own;
You should write a poem to be in the Milo thrown.
```
