长生殿 丑宫女

自小生来貌天然，花面；
宫娥队里我为先，扫殿。
忽逢小监在阶前，胡缠；
伸手摸他裤儿边，不见。

我做宫娥第一，标致无人能及。
腮边花粉糊涂，嘴上胭脂狼藉。
秋波俏似铜铃，弓眉弯得笔直。
春纤十个擂槌，玉体浑身糙漆。
柳腰松段十围，莲瓣滩船半只。
杨娘娘爱我伶俐，选做《霓裳》部色。
只因喉咙太响，歌时嘴边起个霹雳。
身子又太狼伉，舞去冲翻了御筵桌席。
皇帝见了发恼，打落子弟名籍
登时发到骊山，派到温泉殿中承值。
昨日銮舆临幸，同杨娘娘在华清驻跸。
传旨要来共浴汤池，只索打扫铺陈收拾。

Funny Maid: I was born with natural grace,
Though with a pockmarked face.
I am the first maid of honor, 
first of all,To sweep the palace hall.
I try to flirt with a eunuch above,
But he cannot make love.
I put into his pants my hand,
But find him nota husband.
I am the first maid of honor on duty;
No other maids can rival me in beauty.
My cheeks are smeared with powder white,
My lips with rouge too bright.
As two bronze balls my eyes are fine;
My arched brows form a straight line.
Each of my fingers looks like a drumstick 
My skin like coarse varnish thick,
My willowy waist is too heavy to take a seat 
As big as boats are my lotus-like feet.
Lady Yang who loved my wit 
Chose me to dance a bit,
But my voice is as loud 
As thunder from the cloud
In dance I turned the table upside down,
Which annoyed the imperial crown,
Who forbade me to dance and sing,
And sent me to the palace in Warm Spring 
The emperor came with Lady Yang yesterday,
And by the Flower-Clear Pool they would stay 
They are going to take a bath today,
And I am ordered to sweep the pathway
