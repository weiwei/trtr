Drinking Wine
Among the haunts of men I build my cot,
There's noise of wheels and hoofs, but I hear not.
How can it leave upon my mind no trace?
Secluded heart creates secluded place.
I pick fence-side chrysanthemums at will
And leisurely I see the southern hill,
Where mountain air is fresh both day and night,
And where I find home-going birds in flight.
What is the revelation at this view?
Words fail me e'en if I try to tell you.

饮酒
结庐在人境，而无车马喧。问君何能尔？心远地自偏。采菊东篱下，悠然见南山。山气日夕佳，飞鸟相与还。此中有真意，欲辩已忘言。

咏柳
碧玉妆成一树高，万条垂下绿丝绦。
不知细叶谁裁出，二月春风似剪刀。
回乡偶书
少小离家老大回，乡音无改鬓毛衰。
儿童相见不相识，笑问客从何处来？

The Willow

The slender tree is dressed in emerald all about,
A thousand branches droop like fringes made of jade.
But do you know by whom these slim leaves are cut out?
The wind of early spring is sharp as scissor blade.

Homecoming

Old, I return to the homeland I left while young,
Thinner has grown my hair, though I speak the same tongue.
My children, whom I meet, do not know who am I.
"Where are you from, dear sir?" they ask with beaming eye.

观沧海
东临碣石，以观沧海。水何澹澹，山岛竦峙。树木丛生，百草丰茂。秋风萧瑟，洪波涌起。日月之行，若出其中;星汉灿烂，若出其里。幸甚至哉，歌以咏志。

The Sea
I come to view the boundless ocean
From Stony Hill on eastern shore.
Its water rolls in rhythmic motion,
And islands stand amid its roar.
Tree on tree grows from peak to peak;
Grass on grass looks lush far and nigh.
The autumn wind blows drear and bleak;
The monstrous billows surge up high.
The sun by day, the moon by night
Appear to rise up from the deep.
The Milky Way with stars so bright
Sinks down into the sea in sleep.
How happy I feel at this sight!
I croon this poem in delight.
