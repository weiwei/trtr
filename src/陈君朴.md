## 宋词汉英绝句200首

A Small Pond *

```
喷泉无声地滴水，仿佛为了不让它流淌；
水色清亮，树影婆娑。
当小荷花绽放出花蕾时，**
一只蜻蜓已经飞落在上面，以表达它的喜悦。
```

```
The fountain drips soundless as if to spare its flow; 
Bright and gentle, the water mirrors the tree shadow. 
As soon as the little lotus puts out its budding tip, ** 
A dragonfly has already alighted on it his joy to show.
```
```
泉眼无声惜细流,
树阴照水爱晴柔。
小荷才露尖尖角,**
早有蜻蜓立上头。
```

波特*

```
周围的地球都变成了瓷砖，
然而陶工们还没有瓦顶的房子。
手指未沾泥的人
住在高处闪闪发光的豪宅里。
```

The Potter *

```
All the earth around has gone to making tiles, 
Yet the potters have not had a house tile-roofed. 
Those whose fingers are ne'er stained with mud 
Are living in glittering mansions that stand aloft.
```


陶者*

```
陶尽门前土,
屋上无片瓦。
十指不沾泥,
鳞鳞居大厦。
```

阅读感想*

```
方池半亩明镜明，**
其中玩既云
阴影和阳光。 这么清澈、这么干净的水是从哪里来的？
什么都没有，只有一个安静的实时信号源。
```

Thoughts upon Reading *

```
The half mu of the square pond is a mirror bright, **
Wherein play both the cloud
shadow and sunlight. Whence comes the water, so clear and so clean? 
Nothing, only there is a live source running quiet.
```

观书有感 *

```
半亩方塘一鉴开, 
天光云影共徘徊。 
问渠那得清如许, 
为有源头活水来。
```

11 月 4 日狂风倾盆*

```
寒冷而孤独的小屋里，我的悲伤没有尽头，
作为北部边界，我仍然热衷于保卫。 **
深夜，我躺下，听风雨；
进入我的梦境，骑士跨过冰冷的河裂缝。
```

Howling Gale and Torrential Rain on 4th of November *

```
Cold and alone in a hut, my sadness comes to no end, 
As the northern borders I am still keen to defend. ** 
In deep night, I lie down and listen to the gale and rain; 
Into my dream, across an icy river crack cavaliers wend.
```

十一月四日风雨大作*

```
僵卧孤村不自哀,
尚思为国戍轮台。** 
夜阑卧听风吹雨, 
铁马冰河入梦来。
```

吴河 *

```
活着，做一个狮子心肠的人，
死了，一种英勇而真实的精神。
这就是为什么，我想，项羽，
拒绝渡过吴江
```

The River Wu *

```
Living, be a lion-hearted man, 
Dead, a spirit heroic and true. 
That's why, I think, Xiang Yu, 
Refused to cross the River Wu
```

乌江*

```
生当作人杰, 死亦为鬼雄。 
至今思项羽, 不肯过江东。
```

元旦 *

```
鞭炮声阵阵，旧的一年即将过去，
春风送暖入酒屠苏。 *
当阳光照耀着家家户户的时候，我们都赶紧把桃木板换成新的。 **
```

New Year's Day *

```
200 Chinese-English Quatrains by Song Poets
Amid the bursts of firecrackers, the old year's now to go,
The spring wind sends warmth into the wine Tu Su. *
When the sun is shining on each and every household, We all hurry to change old peach boards with the new. **
```

元日

```
爆竹声中一岁除,
春风送暖入屠苏。*
千门万户瞳瞳日,
总把新桃换旧符。**
```

养蚕女*

```
我昨天进城了
回来时流下了无尽的泪水：
穿丝衣者不生虫，
我是来学习的。
```

The Silkworm-Raising Woman *

```
I went into the town yesterday 
And shed endless tears on return: 
Those who wear silk dresses Raise no worms, 
I come to learn.
```

蚕妇*

```
昨日入城市, 
归来泪满巾。 
遍身罗绮者, 
不是养蚕人。
```

## 绝句

竹里馆
王维
独坐幽篁里, 弹琴复长啸。
深林人不知, 明月来相照。
In a Bamboo Grove
Wang Wei
Sitting in a bamboo grove alone, I play the zither and long croon. Deep in the grove, no one sees me And high above is shining the moon.


逢入京使
岑参
故园东望路漫漫, 双袖龙钟泪不干。 马上相逢无纸笔, 凭君传语报平安。
Encountering an Envoy Returning to Capital
Cen Shen
The eastward road to my home is a long, long way; My tears old and new fore'er on my sleeves stay. As I have no pen and paper at hand on horseback, Please tell my family that I'm well as of old day.


蜂
罗隐
不论平地与山尖, 无限风光尽被占。 采得百花成蜜后, 为谁辛苦为谁甜?
Bees
Luo Yin
Up to mountain tips and down over plains, I see You are in search of each flowering plant and tree. But when honey is made from nectars of all kinds, Who tastes the sweetness of your toil with glee?


枫桥夜泊
张继
月落乌啼霜满天, 江枫渔火对愁眠。
姑苏城外寒山寺, 夜半钟声到客船。
*夜半敲钟是当时习惯,名为“无常钟”。
Moored at Maple Bridge for the Night
Zhang Ji
Sinking moon, cawing crows, falling frost from sky. Facing maples and fisherman's fire, in sadness I lie. From Cold Hill Temple outside the city of Suzhou, The midnight bell peals reach my boat and pass by.

* Striking a bell at midnight was a custom at a Buddhist temple at that time. It is called "Mutation Bell".

秋思
莊
张籍
洛阳城里见秋风, 欲作家书意万重。 复恐匆匆说不尽, 行人临发又开封。
Autumn Thoughts
Zhang Ji
The autumn wind now blows all over the city of Luoyang;
While I am writing a letter home, all thoughts crowd in. Just before the messenger starts, I open the letter again,
Afraid that there might be something I've missed saying.
