克洛依·伽西亚·罗伯茨译李商隐诗四首

XIE FANG OF THE SENIOR EXAMINATION CLASS MEMORIZED AND RECITED MANY OF MY POEMS, ONE DAY I HAPPENED TO SEND HIM THIS

At dawn, use clouds to conceive the lines.

In winter, hold snow to divine the poem.

On good days, the self is often moved,

though impossible a writer always be so.

First resembling a crane in full sleep,

then a cicada with its closed-mouth shriek of desire.

When composing, momentum never unfolds.

Arriving at the predetermined, fitting it be pre-condemned.

At the head of the Southern River: endless trees.

At the Western Tower: shifting haze.

Edits complete, everyone silent, still.

Send it away down a road unbroken, unending.

A constellation of stars hangs to earth in the cold.

River sounds ascend to heaven at dawn.

If, dear sir, you commiserate

let this poem express it.

DRUNK UNDER FLOWERS

Seeking sweetness, insensible, drunk on streaming glowing clouds,

I rested against a tree, sunk into sleep, sun already slanting.

After the guests left, woken from intoxication into deep night:

Still clutching the red candle, I delight in waning flowers.

UNTITLED

Come is a hollow word, Go severs all traces

Moon slanting over building roofs, bells of the fifth watch

Dreaming of distant parting, my weeping: a faltering summons

Rushed with this letter, ink failing to congeal

Candle-shine almost ensnaring golden kingfishers

Musk-smoke subtly traversing embroidered lotuses

Young Liu had despised the distance to Peng mountain,

Yet on the far side of Peng mountain, ten-thousand iterations more

BROCADED ZITHER

A brocaded zither for no reason, fifty-stringed

Each string, each peg, recalling shining years

Master Zhuang’s dawn dream: adrift in a butterfly

Emperor Wang’s spring heart: sheltered in a cuckoo

Seablue, moonbeam, pearls hold tears

Indigo-fields, sun-warmth, jade begets smoke

I could consider this feeling a memory sought

Only by this time, I was already wavering

附原作

谢先辈防纪念拙诗甚多异日偶有此寄

晓用云添句, 寒将雪命篇。

良辰多自感, 作者岂皆然。

熟寝初同鹤, 含嘶欲并蝉。

题时长不展, 得处定应偏。

南浦无穷树, 西楼不住烟。

改成人寂寂, 寄与路绵绵。

星势寒垂地, 河声晓上天。

夫君自有恨, 聊借此中传。

花下醉

寻芳不觉醉流霞，倚树沉眠日已斜。

客散酒醒深夜后，更持红烛赏残花。

无 题

来是空言去绝踪，月斜楼上五更钟。

梦为远别啼难唤，书被催成墨未浓。

蜡照半笼金翡翠，麝熏微度绣芙蓉。

刘郎已恨蓬山远，更隔蓬山一万重。

锦 瑟

锦瑟无端五十弦，一弦一柱思华年。

庄生晓梦迷蝴蝶，望帝春心托杜鹃。

沧海月明珠有泪，蓝田日暖玉生烟。

此情可待成追忆，只是当时已惘然。
