A sorrowful wind crosses the high pavilion, the morning sun glitters through the northern wood. You are now ten thousand li from me where the rivers are long and lakes are deep. Our boats cannot get to touch prow to prow, the pain of separation is too much to bear. A lonely goose is flying south and passing the courtyard keening his loss. Craning my neck I long for you who are far away and beg this bird to carry my lingering song. All of a sudden its shadow is gone from sight, as it flaps its wings, leaving me in sorrow.

Poem

高台多悲风,朝日照北林。

之子在万里,江湖迥且深。

方舟安可极,离思故难任。

孤雁飞南游,过庭长哀吟。

翘思慕远人,愿欲托遗音。

形影忽不见,翩翩伤我心


A Farewell to Wang Wei

Quiet and lonely, what am I waiting for? Morning on morning I come back empty handed. I wish to go away to seek out fragrant plants,¹ but regret having to leave my friend. Who among the powerful will support me? A bosom friend is hard to find in the world. Why not then go to live in solitude, and close the gate to my farmstead home?

留别王维

寂寂竟何待?

朝朝空自归。

欲寻芳草去, 惜与故人违。

当路谁相假?

只应守索寞, 还掩故园扉。

知音世所稀。


A "Liang Fu" Song at Mount Tai

Each of the Eight Directions has its own climate, even the wind and rain feel different a thousand li away.

Life is hard for the sea-coast folk: they make their living from the wilderness, their wives and children are like beasts, they are the slaves of barren forest and hills. How desolate these wicket gates! Foxes and rabbits hanging around the house.

泰山梁甫行

八方各异气,千里殊风雨。

剧哉边海民,寄身于草墅。

妻子像禽兽,行止依林阻。

柴门何萧条!狐兔翔我宇。
